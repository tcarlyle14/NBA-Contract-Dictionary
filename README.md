        The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in the United States that currently consists of 30 teams. Each team has approximately 12-18 players on its roster at any given time, and players are signed to teams through monetary contracts. The total sum of player contracts for a team per year cannot exceed the NBA salary cap, which is currently set at $188,931,000. This salary cap changes annually, providing teams with more flexibility as the years go on.

        This program provides a simulation of team roster building, allowing users to keep track of player rosters by adding, removing, and trading players among all 30 teams. Users can also adjust the salary cap, which will impact the amount a team can pay new players that are added to the team.
